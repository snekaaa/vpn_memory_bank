# X3UI API Testing Suite

## 📋 Overview

This testing suite validates the enable/disable functionality of X3UI panel API before implementing the main VPN key access control feature.

## 🎯 Purpose

Before implementing the subscription-based VPN key access control, we need to ensure that:
1. ✅ We can successfully enable/disable clients in 3xUI panel
2. ✅ The API methods work reliably
3. ✅ Client status changes are properly verified
4. ✅ All edge cases are handled correctly

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Configure Test Panel
Edit `test_x3ui_api_methods.py` and update the test panel configuration:

```python
test_node = {
    "base_url": "https://your-panel-url.com",  # ⚠️ CHANGE THIS
    "username": "admin",                       # ⚠️ CHANGE THIS  
    "password": "your-password"                # ⚠️ CHANGE THIS
}
```

### Step 2: Run Tests
```bash
cd vpn-service/backend/
./run_x3ui_tests.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
python3 test_x3ui_api_methods.py
```

## 🧪 Test Cases

The test suite covers:

1. **Connection Test**: Verify X3UI panel login
2. **Client Creation**: Create test client with unique email
3. **Client Info Retrieval**: Get client status via API
4. **Client Disable**: Turn off client (enable=false)
5. **Disable Verification**: Confirm client is disabled
6. **Client Enable**: Turn on client (enable=true)  
7. **Enable Verification**: Confirm client is enabled
8. **Cleanup**: Remove test clients

## 📊 Test Output

Expected successful output:
```
🧪 Starting X3UI API Tests...
✅ PASS X3UI Connection: Successfully connected to X3UI panel
✅ PASS Create Test Client: Test client created successfully
✅ PASS Get Client Info: Client found with enable status: True
✅ PASS Disable Client: Client disable result: True
✅ PASS Disable Verification: Client successfully disabled
✅ PASS Enable Client: Client enable result: True
✅ PASS Enable Verification: Client successfully enabled
✅ PASS Enable/Disable Cycle: Cycle completed. Disable: True, Enable: True
✅ PASS Cleanup Test Client: Cleanup client test_enable_disable_xxx: True

📊 TEST REPORT
==============
Total Tests: 8
✅ Passed: 8
❌ Failed: 0
Success Rate: 100.0%

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:
✅ All tests passed! Ready to proceed with main implementation.

🔧 NEXT STEPS:
1. ✅ enable_client_by_email method implemented and working
2. ✅ toggle functionality (_toggle_client_status) implemented
3. 🚀 Ready to proceed to VPNAccessControlService implementation
4. 🚀 Ready to proceed to VPNKeyLifecycleService implementation
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Real Panel Required**: Tests need access to a real 3xUI panel
2. **Test Client Creation**: The test will create and delete test clients
3. **Credentials**: Make sure panel credentials are correct
4. **Network Access**: Panel must be accessible from where tests run

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```
❌ FAIL X3UI Connection: Failed to connect to X3UI panel
```
**Solutions:**
- Check panel URL (include https:// or http://)
- Verify credentials (username/password)
- Ensure panel is running and accessible
- Check firewall/network connectivity

### Client Creation Issues
```
❌ FAIL Create Test Client: No inbounds available for testing
```
**Solutions:**
- Ensure panel has at least one configured inbound
- Check inbound configuration is valid
- Verify panel permissions

### Enable/Disable Issues
```
❌ FAIL Disable Client: Client disable result: False
```
**Solutions:**
- Check panel API permissions
- Verify inbound update permissions
- Review panel logs for errors

## 📋 Files Overview

- `test_x3ui_api_methods.py` - Main test suite
- `run_x3ui_tests.sh` - Test runner script
- `X3UI_API_TESTING_README.md` - This documentation

## 🔄 Integration with Main Task

After successful testing:
1. ✅ **Confidence in API reliability**
2. 🚀 **Proceed to VPNAccessControlService** (Step 3)
3. 🚀 **Proceed to VPNKeyLifecycleService** (Step 5)
4. 🚀 **Implement subscription-based key control**

## 📈 Expected Results

- **100% Pass Rate**: All tests should pass for production readiness
- **Reliable enable/disable**: Client status changes work consistently  
- **Proper verification**: Status changes are confirmed via API
- **Clean cleanup**: Test clients are properly removed

## 🚨 If Tests Fail

**DO NOT PROCEED** with main implementation until:
1. ✅ All API issues are resolved
2. ✅ Tests achieve 100% pass rate
3. ✅ Panel connectivity is stable
4. ✅ Enable/disable functionality is reliable

The main subscription-based access control depends entirely on reliable client enable/disable functionality.
