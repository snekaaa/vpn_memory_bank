# Reflection on Task: Production Hotfix & Deployment Stabilization (2025-07-09)

## 1. Implementation Summary: What Was Done

The initial task to "fix the Robokassa signature" escalated into a full-scale stabilization of the production environment.

- **Payment Gateway:** Corrected the signature generation logic for Robokassa integration.
- **Configuration:** Resolved numerous environment configuration (`.env`) and networking (`DNS`) errors that prevented services from communicating with each other and the database.
- **Deployment Process:** Created and tested a reliable, fault-tolerant `deploy.sh` script from scratch. Production updates are now deployed with a single, predictable command.
- **Legacy Bot Restoration:** Located and successfully launched the "lost" legacy bot, which now runs in parallel with the new system without conflicts.
- **Process Verification:** The new deployment process was validated with a live, simple UI change (updating an icon in the admin panel), confirming its effectiveness.

## 2. What Went Well: Successes

- **Mission Accomplished:** Despite significant challenges, the primary objective was achieved. The admin panel, both bots, and the payment systems are fully operational.
- **Reliable Deployment:** The `deploy.sh` script is a massive step forward for project stability, eliminating error-prone manual manipulations on the server.
- **Deep Debugging:** We successfully identified and resolved deep, non-obvious issues (e.g., `.env` variables not updating on `restart`), providing invaluable insight into the system's behavior.

## 3. What Went Wrong: Challenges & Failures

- **Initial Approach:** The first deployment attempts were catastrophic. Executing `docker-compose down` on a live server without understanding the consequences was **a major failure on my part**, leading to service downtime.
- **Environmental Ignorance:** I operated blindly, unaware of the old `docker-compose` version's peculiarities and failing to verify the actual server configuration before acting. This led to significant wasted time.
- **Bot Confusion:** A critical misunderstanding—that two different bots with separate tokens needed to run—caused a long and fruitless debugging session on the "unresponsive" new bot.

## 4. What We Learned: Lessons for the Future

- **The Golden Rule of Production:** Never run destructive commands (`down`, `rm`) on a live server without a 100% clear understanding of the consequences and a rollback plan.
- **`docker-compose restart` is Deceptive:** This command **does not** reliably update environment variables from `.env` files. To apply configuration changes, **always** use a full `down` and `up --build` cycle, as our new `deploy.sh` script does.
- **"Verify, Don't Assume":** This is the key lesson from this session. We cannot trust what *should* be in a container. We must get inside (`docker exec`) and check the actual environment (`printenv`). This would have saved hours.
- **Reconnaissance First:** Before any action on an unfamiliar server, a full inventory is required: `docker ps -a`, `ls -lA` in key directories, and checking software versions.

## 5. Potential Improvements: Future Ideas

- **Separate Compose Files:** For greater clarity, the legacy bot could have its own version-controlled `docker-compose.old-bot.yml` within the main project, rather than running from a separate, unversioned directory. The current solution, however, is functional.
- **Server Documentation:** Create a `SERVER_README.md` in the project root detailing the production architecture: where projects are located, what scripts are responsible for what, and contact points. This will be invaluable for anyone working on the server in the future.
