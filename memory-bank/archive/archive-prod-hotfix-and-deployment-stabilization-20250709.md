# Archive: Production Hotfix & Deployment Stabilization

- **Date:** 2025-07-09
- **Status:** COMPLETED

## 1. Task Summary

This task involved resolving a critical "Invalid Signature" error from the Robokassa payment gateway on the production server. The initial fix escalated into a full-scale stabilization of the production environment, which included:
- Correcting multiple environment configuration and networking issues.
- Creating a new, reliable deployment script (`deploy.sh`).
- Locating and successfully relaunching a separate, legacy bot service that was also down.
- Verifying the entire deployment pipeline with a live UI change.

## 2. Key Outcomes

- All production services (new system + legacy bot) are fully operational.
- A robust, one-command deployment script is now in place for future updates.
- The root causes of system instability were identified and resolved.

## 3. Reflection & Learnings

A detailed analysis of the challenges, failures, and lessons learned during this task has been documented separately. This document serves as a critical knowledge base for preventing similar issues in the future.
